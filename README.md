### Technologies Used

- Vue.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Lessons Learned

1. **Efficient Lightbox Gallery Implementation**:
   Mastered the creation of a lightbox gallery with seamless dynamic switching for thumbnails.

2. **Advanced CSS Techniques for Image Centering**:
   Utilized top-2/4 transform and translate-y-1/2 to effectively center items inside images.

3. **Component Communication Optimization with defineProps and Emits**:
   Successfully implemented defineProps() and defineEmits() in Vue.js to enhance component communication. First defined custom events using defineEmits(['addCart']). It emits the 'addCart' event with the necessary data inside an event function. Next listened to the custom event on the parent component and handled the emitted data. Finally defined a new const to store the received data and updated the component accordingly.

4. **Leveraging Vue Slots for Modular Design**:
   Utilized Vue's slots component to seamlessly integrate parent content into child components.

5. **Dynamic Theming with :root Theme Colors**:
   Utilized :root theme colors for the project, enabling the easy creation of dynamic themes.
